# Cancer Detection using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a deep learning model for cancer detection using image analysis. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, with 18.1 million new cases and 9.6 million cancer-related deaths in 2018. Early detection and diagnosis are critical for effective treatment and survival.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of images of cancer cells, labeled as benign or malignant. The images are preprocessed and augmented using techniques such as resizing, rescaling, and data augmentation.

## Model
The model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) built using TensorFlow and Keras. The architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function.

## Features
- Image analysis for cancer detection
- Deep learning model using CNN
- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Classification report for model evaluation

## Requirements
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- Scikit-image
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## Usage
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the preprocessing script to prepare the dataset.
3. Train the model using the training script.
4. Evaluate the model using the evaluation script.
5. Use the model for cancer detection on new images.
